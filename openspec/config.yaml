  Tech stack: 
    - Frontend: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Zustand, Socket.io-client, React Router v7
    - Backend: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Socket.io
  Architecture: Monorepo with frontend/ and backend/ directories
  Testing: None configured
  Style: ESLint with React hooks rules, Tailwind CSS v4

paths:
  frontend: frontend/
  backend: backend/

rules:
  proposal:
    - Include rollback plan for risky changes
    - Identify affected modules/components
  specs:
    - Use Given/When/Then format for scenarios
    - Use RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHALL, SHOULD, MAY)
  design:
    - Include sequence diagrams for complex flows
    - Document architecture decisions with rationale
  tasks:
    - Group tasks by phase (infrastructure, implementation, testing)
    - Use hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
    - Keep tasks small enough to complete in one session
  apply:
    - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
    - Use explicit imports (no path aliases)
    - Name components in PascalCase, functions/variables in camelCase
  verify:
    - Run type-check (tsc -b) and build before committing
    - Run linting (pnpm lint)
    - Compare implementation against every spec scenario
  archive:
    - Warn before merging destructive deltas (large removals)
